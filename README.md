# AI-Assignment

Add a README.md explaining what the notebook is trying to analyze and how you used AI to help.

  The notebook is analyzing which model is better suited to detect fraud, whether it be with chip transactions, repeated customers, or other factors, so that credit card fraud can be predicted and prevented in the future. The AI was able to process and compute the models using pandas, seaborn, and ultimately KNN and other approaches quickly, reducing the time required for human coding and minimizing the possibility of mistakes. The AI helps assist humans, ultimately making the predictions more helpful and beneficial.

5. README.md: Have a 2-paragraph section in here where you reflect on AI assistance with
this assignment
a. What concrete benefits did you see by utilizing AI to help you make the notebook?
b. What dangers do you see for someone using AI to make this notebook without
learning data science properly? Give concrete examples.
c. Give examples where you needed to verify the AI output for correctness. How did
you know to verify those outputs?
